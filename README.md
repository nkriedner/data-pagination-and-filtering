# Data Pagination and Filtering

This project is the second task for Teamtreehouse's "Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree".

The task was to bring the given data (a list of student objects) on the page and to include pagination buttons at the bottom and a working search bar.
In the search bar the user can type in any letter which will show all student names containing this letter or letter combinations somewhere in their names.

The html and css files (as well as the data) were given by Teamtreehouse and not to be changed.
The code I wrote for the pagination and filtering is in the script.js file.
